# My Lil' Goblin
*A small friend simulator*

## About the Game 
As you get you're coming back from your latest adventure, you run into a little goblin on your path. He introduces himself as "Krubkis" and puts out a small hand. 

You're a little apprehensive at first but you begin talking to the small creature and he says *"I only have a few requests. If you fulfill them, i'll be your friend for life. If not, well I'm not sure I can be so kind*

Do you accept the challenge?

*Inspired by my small pug daisy who I call Goblin and is quite demanding*
