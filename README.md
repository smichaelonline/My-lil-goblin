# My Lil' Goblin
*A small friend simulator*

## About the Game 
As you're coming back from your latest adventure, you run into a little goblin on your path. He introduces himself as "Krubkis" and waves.

You're a little apprehensive at first but you begin talking to the small creature and he says *"I only have a few requests. If you fulfill them, i'll be your friend for life. If not, well I'm not sure I can be so kind"*

His request will pop up and prompt you to click one of the items below. If you on the click the correct item, you'll gain points to fill his happiness bar and a new request will be displayed. If you click on the wrong item, you'll lose many more points than you gain. Krubkis has very little patience.

Do you accept the challenge?

*Inspired by my small pug daisy who I call Goblin and is quite demanding*
